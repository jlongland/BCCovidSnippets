This notebook shows the confirmed COVID cases for Canadian provinces.
The code for this notebook is [available for anyone to adapt and use for
their own
purposes](https://github.com/mountainMath/BCCovidSnippets/blob/main/two_covid_canadas.Rmd).

The Atlantic provinces have pursued very different COVID-19 strategies

For better comparison we can plot the Atlantic provinces and the other
provinces on different scales.
