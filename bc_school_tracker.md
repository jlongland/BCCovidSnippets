In BC we donâ€™t have good data on community level COVID cases. But we
can, somewhat cynically, use school exposures as a proxy. The [BC School
Covid Tracker
project](https://bcschoolcovidtracker.knack.com/bc-school-covid-tracker#home/)
has been keeping count of school exposures and meticulously documenting
and geocoding the data. That makes is easy for use to create a heatmap
of school exposures.

## Variants of concern

The share of school exposures that are related to variants of concern
can give an indication of the general proliferation of variants of
concern.

We look at the share of school exposures involving variants of concern
for each week, where we split the week between Monday and Tuesday as
exposure notifications coming out on Monday usually relate to exposures
in the preceding week.

## School Exposure Heat Map

This data is not normalized by population, so it should be viewd in
context of the school aged (5-17yo) population further down.

## Monthly exposure density

Looking at monthly school exposure denisty gives us some sense of how
the distribution of exposure notifications has changed over time. The
last month only has partial data.
